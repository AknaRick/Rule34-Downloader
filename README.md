### FAQ

**Can I search for more than one tag at once?**

> Yes, the program treats each word as a tag; so ``gay furry`` is
> treated as two tags; ``gay`` and ``furry``

**What about multi-word tags?** 

>The program treats them the same way rule34 does, usually with
>underscores. Id suggest searching on rule34 first to make sure its a
>real tag. 

**Can i download a specific amount of images?**

> Yes, when running the program will ask you if you want to limit how
> many images are downloaded
