### FAQ

**Can I search for more than one tag at once?**

>Yes, the program treats each word as a tag; so ``gay mario`` is
> treated as two tags; ``gay`` and ``mario``

**What about multi_word tags?** 

>The program treats them the same way rule34 does, usually with
>underscores. I'd suggest searching on rule34 first to make sure it's a
>real tag. 

**Can I download a specific amount of posts?**

> Yes, there is a field to enter a specific limit

**Can I save a list of URLs?**

>Yes there's a checkbox for that

**[Insert antivirus here] says this is a virus**

> I can assure you, this is not a virus. I'm not entirely sure why anti-viruses sometimes flag this as a virus,
> at a guess, I assume its because of how many requests it makes. Either way, if you're worried, you can see the source
> code, and run straight from the py file
